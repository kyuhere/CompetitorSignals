You are updating a TypeScript/React monorepo to add a “Quick Summary” flow for tracked competitors.

Goal
- Add an endpoint to build and persist a compact “Quick Summary” report for the current user’s tracked competitors.
- Wire the Tracked Competitors button to call it.
- Render a one-page summary in the Home page card/modal.
- Reuse a recent matching report (same canonical competitor set) for speed.

Backend changes
1) server/routes.ts
- Add POST /api/competitors/tracked/quick-summary (isAuthenticated).
- Steps:
  - Load tracked competitors: storage.getUserTrackedCompetitors(userId), map to names.
  - Implement a local toCanonical(s: string) helper (reuse logic in routes):
    - lower → strip protocol/www → first token before '/' → base label before '.' → alnum only.
  - Build canonical set key: 'tracked_qs:' + sorted unique canonical names joined by '|'.
  - Try to reuse a recent matching report:
    - const reports = await storage.getUserReports(userId, 10)
    - For each report, reconstruct its canonical set from report.competitors.
    - If same canonical set and createdAt within 14 days, use report.summary to produce the compact payload (if summary is already compact, use as-is; if it’s the full analysis, derive a compact snapshot using top-level fields like executive_summary, competitors[*].recent_developments).
  - Else generate fresh quick summary:
    - const signals = await signalAggregator.aggregateSignals(competitorList, [], { news: true, funding: true, social: true, products: false });
    - const preview = await generateFastPreview(signals, competitorList); // Returns concise JSON string
    - Parse preview and map into compact payload:
      {
        meta: { generatedAt: new Date().toISOString(), competitorCount: competitorList.length, canonicalKey },
        executiveSummary: "<2–3 sentences>",
        competitorSnippets: [{ competitor: "Name", bullets: ["Key update", "Activity level"] }...],
        topSignals: ["Top finding 1", "Top finding 2", "Top finding 3"]
      }
  - Persist report via storage.createReport({
      userId,
      title: `Quick Summary (Tracked) — ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}`,
      competitors: competitorList,
      signals: [], // quick summary is analysis-only
      summary: JSON.stringify(compactPayload),
      metadata: {
        ...compactPayload.meta,
        type: 'quick_summary'
      }
    })
  - Return { id, title, summary: compactPayload, createdAt }.

2) server/services/openai.ts
- No changes; reuse generateFastPreview(signals, competitorNames).

3) server/email.ts
- Ensure From can use verified domain:
  - Read env RESEND_FROM (e.g., "Competitor Lemonade Reports <send@builtagent.com>") and RESEND_REPLY_TO.
  - (Optional but recommended) include a plaintext body for deliverability.

Frontend changes
1) client/src/components/TrackedCompetitors.tsx
- Find the "Analyze Now" button and:
  - Change text to: "Create Quick Summary".
  - On click:
    - Call POST /api/competitors/tracked/quick-summary.
    - On success: store the returned quick summary (id, summary JSON).
    - Open a modal or card to render the one-page summary:
      - Executive summary paragraph.
      - “By competitor”: name + up to 2 bullets (wrap long text).
      - “Top signals”: up to 3 bullets.
    - If premium: show "Email this summary" button which calls POST /api/reports/:id/email.
    - If free: show an upgrade CTA tooltip or disabled email button.

2) client/src/pages/home.tsx
- Within the “Track Your Competitors” card, add a container/modal hook to display the quick summary (so the user sees immediate output on the Home page).
- Keep the layout minimalist and readable in one page height.

Env
- Add to .env.example:
  - RESEND_FROM="Competitor Lemonade Reports <send@builtagent.com>"
  - RESEND_REPLY_TO="support@builtagent.com"

Acceptance criteria
- Quick summary returns in <= 10s; reuses a matching report within 2s.
- Summary is persisted as a report and can be emailed via existing endpoint.
- The UI button reads “Create Quick Summary” and shows the compact modal/card.
- No regressions to /api/analyze or existing tracked competitors flows.
