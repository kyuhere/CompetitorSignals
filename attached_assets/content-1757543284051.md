This change looks much better, thanks!
\> "It is now Apache 2.0 which grants patent rights and can be re-licensed to PostgreSQL when the code is upstreamed."

It’s worth double-checking the relicensing angle.

Imho: you can only relicense your own code. Any 3rd party contribution stays under apache 2.0 unless the author explicitly agrees.

So a full switch to postgresql license is only possible if every contributor signs off. That usually means having a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) in place up front.

And ethically, contributors should already know their work might be relicensed under "postgresql terms" later - otherwise it's a surprise change for the community.

ps: if the plan is serious, do the legal homework early and gather consents now, so upstreaming to postgresql doesn’t fail later because a few open-source contributors (who aren’t _supabase_/orioledb employees) are unreachable.)

We never train on your prompts or completions, and for the API we don't store longer than 14 days (in fact, we don't ever intentionally store API prompts or completions at all, the 14 day policy was originally just to cover accidental log statements being deployed; we'll probably change it to no-store since it's confusing to say 14 days when we actually don't intentionally store). For the web UI we do have to store, since otherwise we couldn't show you your message history.
In terms of tenancy: we have our own dedicated VMs for our Kubernetes cluster via Azure, although I suspect a VM is not equivalent to an entire hardware node. We use _Supabase_ for our Postgres DB, and Redis for ephemeral data; while we don't share access to that to any other company, we don't create a new DB for every user of our service, so there is user multitenancy there. Similarly, the same GPUs may serve many customers — otherwise we'd need to charge enormous amounts for inference. But, the requests themselves aren't intermingled; i.e. if you make a request, it doesn't affect someone else's.

You're being entirely unfair to _Supabase_ here. Research is important, but there is a reason why the USPTO has developed substantial case law around Reduction to Practice, everything is built on prior work, so to say there is nothing novel about actually building displayed working system from parts is factually inaccurate.

\> To reinforce the IP compatibility, _Supabase_ is making available a non-exclusive license of U.S. Patent (“Durable multiversion B+-tree”) to all OrioleDB users, including proprietary forks, in accordance with the OrioleDB license.
It seems that they have changed their mind to make it even more permissive.

They just relicensed the OrioleDB project under Apache 2.0 an hour ago \[0\], which contains a patent clause.

The whole patents kerfuffle with Facebook was about a larger issue with their patent grant. Critically the issue was that it practically stopped you from suing Facebook for _any_ patent issues (not just those granted for React, which would be more like the standard reactive termination clause), including counter-suits. Here is the key text from their patent license:

```
    The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice,
    for anyone that makes any claim (including by filing any lawsuit, assertion or
    other action) alleging (a) direct, indirect, or contributory infringement or
    inducement to infringe any patent: (i) by Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or
    affiliates, whether or not such claim is related to the Software, (ii) by any
    party if such claim arises in whole or in part from any software, product or
    service of Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether or not
    such claim is related to the Software, or (iii) by any party relating to the
    Software; or (b) that any right in any patent claim of Facebook is invalid or
    unenforceable.

```

And so that was a fairly justified reaction IMHO. Funnily enough, it seems that the license written by _Supabase_ has the same issue -- I suspect this might just be the "default approach" for patent lawyers.
However, MIT has \_no\_ patent protections and is strictly worse than almost _any_ license with some patent protections for users included. The modern landscape of software patent trolls is far less insane than it was in the 90s but I would really think twice about using something that is likely patented under a license other than Apache-2.0, MPLv2, or GPLv3.

[tomnipotent](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tomnipotent)\|[7 hours ago](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45199079)\|[0 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45199079)\|[parent](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45196726)\|on: [OrioleDB Patent: now freely available to the Postgres community](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45196173)

The existing Postgres license already has an "as is" disclaimer, so adding this clause means you want to \_punitively\_ punish companies that sue you for reasons outside of this software. The interpretation then is you want to punish users of your software that find themselves in a (potentially legitimate) situation to sue you over unrelated matters.
For example, if _Supabase_ failed to pay a vendor that happened to use OrioleDB they wouldn't be able to sue you for damages without compromising their stack. That's uncool.

My take-away from the Facebook/React license issue was that the community agrees this violates the spirit of FOSS and invalidates claiming to be open source (at least OSI-approved), with many taking offense to the punitive nature of the clause.

Granted Facebook was in a position to see litigation over a lot more reasons.

[crote](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=crote)\|[7 hours ago](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45198910)\|[0 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45198910)\|[parent](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45196398)\|on: [OrioleDB Patent: now freely available to the Postgres community](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45196173)

Does the current license even allow for friendly forks, or redistribution?
It starts off nice with the usual:

\> PERMISSION TO USE, COPY, MODIFY, AND DISTRIBUTE THIS SOFTWARE AND ITS DOCUMENTATION FOR ANY PURPOSE, WITHOUT FEE, AND WITHOUT A WRITTEN AGREEMENT IS HEREBY GRANTED

.. but then there's the:

\> HEREBY GRANTS A (..) LICENSE TO UNITED STATES PATENT NO. 10,325,030 TO MAKE, HAVE MADE, USE, HAVE USED, OFFER TO SELL, OFFERED TO SELL, SELL, SOLD, IMPORT INTO THE UNITED STATES, IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES, AND OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS SOFTWARE

.. which to me seems to be missing some kind of "modify" clause? Sure, it seems like you're allowing me to distribute it as-is the way a store like Amazon distributes boxes, but what happens when I start modifying the code and distributing those modifications? Is it still "this software", or has it become a derivative? Is the license I get to that patent even sublicensable? What happens to users of a fork when the forkee sues _Supabase_: do they also by extension lose their patent license?

The GPLv2, for example, has a clause stating that "Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor" which makes it _very_ clear what happens. If you're adding a poison pill to open-source code, you _really_ shouldn't be this sloppy: it should be painfully obvious to every reader what the implications are, or nobody will ever risk using it.

The PostgreSQL license does not have a termination clause, you added that. I see that you are trying to use the PostgreSQL license as the basis and simply add the patent clause onto it, but it fundamentally changes the license.
I hope you can look at the Apache 2 patent grant as a better clause- or even adopt something like Google's Additional IP License found here- [https://www.webmproject.org/license/additional/](https://www.webmproject.org/license/additional/), which doesn't modify the open source license but instead adds an additional grant as a separate license.

_Supabase_ is doing great work, thank you!

[samlambert](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=samlambert)\|[8 hours ago](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45198115)\|[0 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45198115)\|[parent](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45196173)\|on: [OrioleDB Patent: now freely available to the Postgres community](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45196173)

This is not an open source license and it's untrue to say it's an open source project when it's licensed this way.
"IF ANY LITIGATION IS INSTITUTED AGAINST _SUPABASE_, INC. BY A LICENSEE OF THIS SOFTWARE, THEN THE LICENSE GRANTED TO SAID LICENSEE SHALL TERMINATE AS OF THE DATE SUCH LITIGATION IS FILED."

This is a poison pill. At best the licensing is naive and blocks even customers of _Supabase_ from using OrioleDB, at worst it's an attempt for _Supabase_ to provide themselves unlimited indemnity through the guise of a community project. It means the moment you sue _Supabase_ for anything. Contract dispute, IP, employment, unrelated tort you lose the license. They could lose your data and if you try do anything about it they can immediately counter sue for a license violation. Using the brand of the postgres license to slip this in is pretty wild.

OrioleDB looks like a promising project and undoubtedly an great contribution from _Supabase_ but it's not open source or really usable by anyone with this license.

We are tracking the patches here:
[https://www.orioledb.com/docs#patch-set](https://www.orioledb.com/docs#patch-set)

The actual storage engine is written as an extension - these patches are mostly to improve the TAM API. If these are accepted by the community then it should be simpler for anyone to write their own Storage extensions.

I think (correctly) it will take a lot longer to upstream the extension - the PG community should take a “default no” attitude with big changes like this. Over time we will prove its worthiness (hopefully beyond just _supabase_ \- it would be good to collaborate with other Postgres providers)

( _Supabase_ ceo)
I’ll revisit this with legal to try make it clearer.

Our intentions here are clear - if people have examples that we can follow we will do what we can to make this irrevocable (even to the extent of donating the patent if/when the community are ready to bear the cost of the maintainance)

The difference is that the license is terminated by ANY litigation against _Supabase_ \- e.g. if you sue them for breach of contract completely unrelated to the software.
Use as a shield would mean limiting it to patent litigation against a user of the software.

It also only covers litigation against _Supabase_ \- it does not provide a shield against litigation against OrioleDB users.

A shield for _Supabase_, not for us

[916c0553e164269](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=916c0553e164269)\|[11 hours ago](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45196398)\|[0 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45196398)\|[parent](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45196173)\|on: [OrioleDB Patent: now freely available to the Postgres community](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45196173)

from the blog:

_"The patent is intended as a shield, not a sword, to protect Open Source from hostile IP claims."_
vs. the current license:

```
  "IF ANY LITIGATION IS INSTITUTED AGAINST SUPABASE, INC. BY A LICENSEE OF THIS SOFTWARE, THEN THE LICENSE GRANTED TO SAID LICENSEE SHALL TERMINATE AS OF THE DATE SUCH LITIGATION IS FILED."

```

( [https://github.com/orioledb/orioledb/blob/main/LICENSE](https://github.com/orioledb/orioledb/blob/main/LICENSE) )
imho: the current wording might discourage state organisations, since even a trivial lawsuit (e.g. a minor tax delay) could terminate the licence - perhaps a narrower patent-focused clause would work better (or an OSI-approved licence?).

_Supabase_ consistently delivering massive value to the postgres ecosystem

[holstein13](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=holstein13)\|[2 days ago](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45168439)\|[0 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45168439)\|[parent](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45168438)\|on: [MCP Config Manager – Stop manually editing JSON files for AI assistant tools](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45168438)

I built this after getting frustrated with manually editing \`.claude.json\` every time I wanted to switch between projects or optimize context usage.
MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are like plugins for AI assistants, but managing them requires manual JSON editing. Want to use different _Supabase_ projects for different clients? Edit JSON. Want to disable resource-heavy servers to save context? Edit JSON. One typo breaks everything.

This tool treats MCP servers like VS Code extensions - easy to toggle, organize, and switch between configurations.

Key features:

\- Interactive CLI for quick server management

\- Project-specific presets (save/load entire configurations)

\- Multi-client support (Claude, Gemini, extensible)

\- Context optimization modes (minimal, webdev, fullstack)

\- Automatic backups before changes

\- Add new servers by pasting JSON (no more syntax errors)

Started as a 300-line script, but rebuilt with proper architecture when I realized this could help the broader MCP community. The CLI is fully functional, GUI development starting.

The "minimal mode" alone saves massive amounts of context - disable everything except essential servers for research/writing, then flip to full toolkit for development.

Built with Python, comprehensive testing, cross-platform support. Looking for contributors, especially for GUI development.

Try it: \`pip install git+ [https://github.com/holstein13/mcp-config-manager.git](https://github.com/holstein13/mcp-config-manager.git) \`
