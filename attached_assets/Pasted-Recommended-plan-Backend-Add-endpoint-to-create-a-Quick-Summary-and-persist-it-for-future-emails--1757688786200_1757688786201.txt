Recommended plan

Backend
Add endpoint to create a “Quick Summary” and persist it for future emails:
POST /api/competitors/tracked/quick-summary
Auth required.
Loads tracked competitors for the current user, canonicalizes them (reuse 
toCanonical()
 logic from 
server/routes.ts
), and builds a stable key.
Reuse a recent matching report:
Get last N user reports (e.g., 10) via storage.getUserReports(userId, 10).
If any report has the same canonical competitor set and is younger than 14 days, reuse its summary to build a compact “quick summary.”
If no match, build a new quick summary fast:
Fetch signals using signalAggregator.aggregateSignals(competitors, [], { news: true, funding: true, social: true, products: false }) to keep it lightweight.
Use 
generateFastPreview(signals, competitorList)
 from 
server/services/openai.ts
 (fast, small tokens).
Compact one-page payload:
executiveSummary: 2–3 sentences.
competitorSnippets: array of {competitor, bullets[1..2]}.
topSignals: up to 3 cross-competitor bullets.
meta: { generatedAt, competitorCount, canonicalKey, source: 'quick_summary' }.
Persist as a new Report via storage.createReport():
title: “Quick Summary (Tracked) — ”
summary: compact payload (stringified JSON).
competitors: the competitor names.
metadata: include { type: 'quick_summary', canonicalKey, generatedAt } for later lookup.
In-memory cache for 30 minutes keyed by the canonical set (optional).
Response: { id, title, summaryCompact, createdAt }.
Frontend
Update Tracked Competitors button:
File: 
client/src/components/TrackedCompetitors.tsx
Replace label “Analyze Now” with “Create Quick Summary”.
On click:
POST /api/competitors/tracked/quick-summary.
Render the compact one-page summary (modal or the Home card space).
Show CTA “Email this summary” (premium only) → POST /api/reports/:reportId/email.
Home page section:
File: 
client/src/pages/home.tsx
Use the existing “Track Your Competitors” card.
When the quick summary is created, display it inside a card/modal that fits one page:
Title, small executive summary paragraph.
“By competitor” bullets (max 2 per competitor).
“Top signals” list (max 3).
Avoid heavy tables; keep it compact.
Email and biweekly digests
Use the stored quick summary report to power biweekly emails for premium users:
Reuse 
server/email.ts
 via POST /api/reports/:id/email.
Set RESEND_FROM="Competitor Lemonade Reports <send@builtagent.com>" so you can send beyond your own Gmail.
Acceptance criteria
Clicking “Create Quick Summary” returns results in 3–10s fresh; <2s when reusing a matching report.
The quick summary is concise and fits in a single page/modal.
The summary is persisted as a report and can be emailed via existing endpoint.
Button label changed and UX is coherent on Home page.
